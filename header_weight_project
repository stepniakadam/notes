I am working on a medium size project having permanent issues with compilation times. There are periodic review of the potential bottlenecks with quite good result, but I was thinking maybe it would be possible to write an automation tool that would help tracking the problem at the very early stage. The common source of problem in our code base is that after some time there are heavy headers included in a commonly used library that bloats into most of translation units making them compiling forever. The other issue are templates but I would like to start only form the first problem. 

The tool I would like to write would introduce a metric that would help track down such bloats automatically. I was thinking about headers_line_count x headers_use_cout (large simplification of the problem, but good starting point)
